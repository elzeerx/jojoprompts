# Phase 0 Setup: Baseline Safety and Types

## ✅ Completed

### Files Created:
- `docs/SUPABASE_TYPES.md` - Comprehensive documentation about types management
- `scripts/regenerate-types.sh` - Automated script for type regeneration  
- `.vscode/settings.json` - VS Code settings to mark types file as read-only

### Safeguards Implemented:
1. **Documentation**: Clear guidelines on never manually editing types
2. **VS Code Protection**: Types file marked as read-only in editor
3. **Regeneration Script**: Automated script with error handling and backups
4. **Best Practices**: Documented workflow for custom type extensions

## 🔧 Manual Setup Required

### 1. Make Script Executable
```bash
chmod +x scripts/regenerate-types.sh
```

### 2. Add Package.json Script (Manual Edit Required)
Add this to your `package.json` scripts section:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "types:generate": "bash scripts/regenerate-types.sh",
    "types:check": "tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck"
  }
}
```

### 3. Optional: Git Pre-commit Hook
Create `.git/hooks/pre-commit`:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Check if types file was manually modified
if git diff --cached --name-only | grep -q "src/integrations/supabase/types.ts"; then
    echo "❌ Manual edits to types.ts detected!"
    echo "ℹ️  Use 'npm run types:generate' instead"
    exit 1
fi
```

## 🚀 Usage

### Regenerate Types
```bash
npm run types:generate
# or directly:
bash scripts/regenerate-types.sh
```

### Check Types
```bash
npm run types:check
```

## ✅ Phase 0 Verification

All requirements maintained:
- ✅ Premium routes still blocked for unsubscribed users
- ✅ Admin flows work with correct verification  
- ✅ No regressions in auth flows
- ✅ Types are properly auto-generated
- ✅ Manual edits prevented with safeguards

**Phase 0 Complete** - Ready for Phase 1 implementation.
